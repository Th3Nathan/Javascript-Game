I created this game as a project for the Udacity class, Object Oriented Javascript. 

The project details are here:

https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

The game engine and art were included, my job was to create and implement a player and enemy class that worked with the engine. After taking the course, it was hard to know where to begin, but once I got that first bug to pop up though, it started to flow. 

I added some extra features:

A scoreboard, gems that appear which will increase the score, the ability to select player avatar, sound effects, and a modal with instructions.

You can try it here:

This is a work in progress. I plan to add a way to win, lives, and varying enemy speeds depending on score.
