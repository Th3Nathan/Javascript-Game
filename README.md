I created this game as a project for the Udacity class, Object Oriented Javascript. 

The project details are here:

https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

The game engine and art were included, my job was to create and implement a player and enemy class that worked with the engine. After taking the course, it was hard to know where to begin, but once I got that first bug to pop up though, it started to flow. 

I added some extra features:

A scoreboard, gems that appear which will increase the score, the ability to select player avatar, sound effects, instructions, a high score, a delay when a player jumps in the water, and three lives.
