I created this game as a project for the Udacity class, Object Oriented Javascript. 

The project details are here:

https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

The game engine and art were included, my job was to create and implement a player and enemy class that worked with it. Even after taking the course, it was hard to know where to start when I actually looked at the code for the first time. Once I got that first bug to pop up though, it started to flow. 

I added some extra features as well:

-A score, and gems that appear which will increase it
-The ability to select player avatar
-Sound effects
-A modal with instructions
